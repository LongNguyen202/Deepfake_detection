# Deepfake_detection
This is the final project of Group 1 from class AI1901.

The objective of this project is a process that uses artificial intelligence, machine learning, and image/video processing techniques to detect fake content created by Deepfake technology. Deepfake detection often relies on anomalies such as eye movements, unnatural facial blurring, false lighting or digital traces left by the image generation process to capture.
